Project Title
  GitHub-Refractors/Refractaing

  Description
    Refactoring existing code and upload on GitHub with a link too. 

    What was my motiviation
      To apply what we learned in css and html to understad the code to see how it can be refactored 
      To get comfrotable with GitHub repisority and uploading code on there. 
      In future assignment it should be much easier to do the uploading on github.
      Also using GitHub will apply to the real workplace in web development, so I know I must master it. 
      Refactroing code will also be part of my future job in coding.
